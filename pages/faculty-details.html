                                I am currently an Associate Professor in the School of Information Technology at
                                Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada. I teach courses provided under the Interactive
                                Multimedia & Design program.

                                I received my PhD from MIRALab, a world famous computer graphics laboratory in Geneva,
                                Switzerland under the Directorship of Professor Nadia Magnenat-Thalmann.

                                I mainly teach 2 undergraduate courses (3D Computer Graphics, and Advanced Animation &
                                VFX) and one Graduate course (Animation Technologies) and work on research topics in the
                                area of computer graphics and multimedia
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                I obtained my Masterâ€™s degrees in Electronics and Communication Engineering from the
                                University of Bath in the U.K., and in Virtual Reality and Information Systems from the
                                University of Geneva, in Switzerland. I obtained my PhD in Network and Spatial Audio in
                                Collaborative Virtual Environments also from the University of Geneva.

                                During my time in Geneva I worked as the main researcher on several key European Union
                                funded projects, which included doing research and development on collaborative virtual
                                environments (VPARK), 3D spatial audio in virtual heritage environments (CAHRISMA), and
                                media adaptation within the MPEG-21 framework (ISIS and DANAE); as well as research
                                demonstrations at technology expositions (IST2000, in France).

                                I regularly teach 2 undergraduate courses and 1 graduate course, as well as supervising
                                several Senior Project groups, and Directed Studies

                                The courses I regularly teach are:
